# Pizza-sales-Analysis-using-Power-bi
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to uncover key business insights related to revenue performance, customer demand, and product popularityy. Using Power BI, the analysis explores sales trends across time (monthly and quarterly), evaluates pizza categories and sizes, and identifies top-performing and underperforming products. The dashboard highlights critical KPIs such as total revenue, total orders, average order value, and pizzas per order, enabling a clear understanding of customer purchasing behavior. Special emphasis is placed on identifying high-demand items and designing data-driven strategies like bundling and upselling to improve order volume and revenue. This project demonstrates the use of DAX measures, data modeling, and interactive visualizations to support business decision-making and showcase practical analytical thinking
